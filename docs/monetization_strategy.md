# 💸 Monetization Strategy (Business Model)

To encourage users to spend money effectively, the following monetization points (BM) are integrated into the current game architecture.

## 1. Gacha System (The Core Revenue Driver)
> **Psychology**: "The thrill of the unknown" and "Desire for collection"

*   **Structure**:
    *   **Normal Summon (Gold)**: Low-tier fodder. Keeps F2P players engaged.
    *   **Premium Summon (Gems)**: The only way to get SSR/UR units efficiently.
*   **Encouragement Strategy**:
    *   **Visual Impact**: Use the "Cinematic Summon View" and "Victory Sprites" to make high-tier units feel incredibly valuable.
    *   **Pity System**: Ensure a guaranteed SSR after 50-100 pulls to prevent churn from bad luck (Safety Net).
    *   **Limited Banners**: Rotate specific "Rate Up" events for new AI-generated characters to create FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).

## 2. Emotional Monetization (Affinity & Gallery)
> **Psychology**: "Attachment" and "Curiosity"

*   **Structure**:
    *   **Secret Gallery**: High-quality (tier 3) images are locked behind "Affinity Levels".
    *   **Gifts**: Affinity rises slowly by interaction, but quickly by "Gifts".
*   **Encouragement Strategy**:
    *   Sell **"Premium Gift Bundles"** that instantly max out affinity.
    *   "I want to see the secret image *now*": This curiosity drives impulse purchases of affinity items.

## 3. Time Solvers (Accelerators)
> **Psychology**: "Impatience" and "Convenience"

*   **Structure**:
    *   **Ether (Energy)**: Required for entering dungeons/stages.
    *   **Offline Rewards**: Capped at a certain duration (e.g., 8 hours).
*   **Encouragement Strategy**:
    *   **Energy Refills**: Sell Ether refills for Gems.
    *   **Battle Skip / Speed Up**: Sell "Skip Tickets" or "3x Speed" features (Subscription model) to bypass the grind.
    *   **Storage Expansion**: Sell inventory slots for Artifacts/Creatures.

## 4. Competitive Advantage (Pay for Power)
> **Psychology**: "dominance" and "Status"

*   **Structure**:
    *   **Artifacts**: Powerful equipment that boosts stats directly.
    *   **Prestige (Rebirth) Multipliers**: Permanent stat boosts.
*   **Encouragement Strategy**:
    *   **Growth Packages**: Sell "Starter Packs" containing SR sets or instant Gold/Exp dumps to jump-start progress.
    *   **Ranking Rewards**: Provide exclusive frames/skins to top rankers, motivating "Whales" to spend on Artifact rerolls and Stamina resets to maintain their rank.

## 5. Ad Integration (Hybrid Model)
> **Psychology**: "Free Stuff"

*   **Structure**:
    *   "Watch Ad for +50 Gems" in the Shop (`ShopView`).
*   **Encouragement Strategy**:
    *   **Ad Removal Pass**: A monthly subscription that grants all ad rewards instantly without watching ads. This is often the highest conversion item for light spenders.
